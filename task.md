#  Data Scientist NLP Task

The exercise is to develop a classifier that can determine from name alone whether an entity entered by its users is one of a number of classes. In this exercise that is 14 non over-lapping classes.

Rather than maintaining an exhaustive and up to date list of terms, the classifier should be trained to categorise an unseen name/entity.

The training data is provided in the file data.csv. Each row is made up of a class label field and the name.

The training set does not contain an equal number of examples from each class, and bracketed annotations and other non-alphanumeric characters have not been cleaned up.

Please provide a Python-based solution, drawing on any Python modules and software frameworks you think are appropriate (and that SB would have access to), supported by a document describing the approach taken and how to run the solution.

It is encouraged to show multiple approaches and provide a commentary as to how they differ, pros and cons that they have, and the respective results. It is very likely that you will think of other approaches that you do not have time to include in the solution, please indicate what they would be and provide commentary on how you would expect the results to compare to those solutions you did provide.

Even though this dataset is very simple on purpose, it is also encouraged that you also give a commentary on your exploration of the data, rather than purely launching into building the classifier.
